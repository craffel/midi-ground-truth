The distribution of the number of instruments in our MIDI files gives us further intuition into the MIDI files' usage; the distribution of program numbers shows us which instruments are more or less popular.  The four most common program numbers (shown as the four tallest bars in the distribution of program numbers) were 0 (“Acoustic Grand Piano”), 48 (“String Ensemble 1”), 33 (“Electric Bass (finger)”), and 25 (“Acoustic Guitar (steel)”)."
